gfipm-ws-status
===============

  This is a GFIPM Web Services Status System.  It is a java tool that uses Metro for 
WS-* support and is built with maven. It requires the trust fabric library available
as part of the GFIPM Web Services toolkit.  As such that project needs to be 
built to add the trust fabric library to your local maven repository.

  There are three main projects:
   - wscontract - This is the Web Services Contract that represents the web service.  
       It specifies the WSDL interface and generates a good bit of automated code for use 
       in the service and consumer.  This must be built first.

   - wsc - This is the web service consumer.  It is a command line java program, typically
       invoked via an included shell script.  'mvn clean install' will build a zipfile that
       includes the script file and all necessary files for invocation.

   - wsp - This is the web service provider.  Maven will build a war file that can be deployed
       to Glassfish.  Do be aware that Glassfish requires extensive configuration to operate
       properly.
